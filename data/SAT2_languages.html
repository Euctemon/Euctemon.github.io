                <h2>Languages</h2>
                <p>
                    Let's take a closer look on the expression \(P \land (Q \lor R)\). We can build this expression from smaller ones. We would say that \(P,Q\) and \(R\) are variables, \(\land\) and \(\lor\) are logical connectives and together they define a <i>proposition</i>. There also have to be some rules what is a valid proposition and what is not. For example \(\land \land P\) is not a proposition. We start with the definition of language and model.
                </p>

                <div class="definition">
                A language is a triple \(L = (\Gamma, \Delta, a) \) where \(\Gamma\), the set of function symbols, and \(\Delta\),the set of relation symbols, are disjoint sets of symbols and \(a\) is a function from \(\Gamma \cup \Delta\) to the set of naturals numbers. The function \(a\) assigns every function and relation symbol its arity.
                </div>

                <div class="definition">
                Fix a language \(L = (\Gamma,\Delta,a) \). We say that \(\mathfrak{M} = (U,I) \) is a model for such language if \(U\) is a set and \(I\) is a function which assigns to each k-ary function symbol in \(\Gamma\) a k-ary function from \(U\) to \(U\) and to each k-ary relation symbol in \(\Delta\) a k-ary relation on \(U\). We call the set \(U\) a universe.
                </div>

                <p>
                    These definitions are rather abstract so it calls for a concrete example. Suppose we have a language with one function symbol \(c\) of zero arity, often call a constant, two binary function symbols \(f,g\) and one binary relation \(r\). We specified the arity of all symbols and the sets of functional symbols and relational symbols are disjoint. This means we have a language \(L\) written as \((\{c,f,g\},\{r\},a)\) where \(a(c) = 0\), \(a(f) = 2\), \(a(g) = 2\) and \(a(r) = 2\). One such model for this language are the natural numbers. We assign \(0\) to the constant \(c\), the functions \(+\) and \(\times\) for function symbols \(f\) and \(g\) and finally the relation \(\leq\) for relation symbol \(r\). The universe is simply the set of natural numbers. We can write this model \(\mathfrak{M}\) as \( (\mathbb{N},\{0,+, \times, \leq\}) \). Note that the functions and the relation satisfy the the conditions on arity.
                </p>

                <h3>Propositional logic</h3>

                <p>
                    It's important to know that propositional logic is a <i>language</i>. This means we need to specify its function and relation symbols and their arities. This logic has one functional symbol of zero arity, namely the symbol for falsity written as \(\bot\). It has three binary functional symbols \(\land,\lor\) and \(\to\) and no relation symbols. We call the set \(\bot,\land,\lor,\to\) an alphabet. We also use a set of <i>propositional variables</i> such as \(P,Q\) or \(R\). Having fixed the alphabet we move to defining the set of propositional formulas.
                </p>

                <div class="definition">
                The set of propositional formulas is a smallest set of strings over the alphabet \( (\bot,\land,\lor,\to) \) satisfying
                <ul>
                    <li>If \(P\) is a propositional variable, then \(P\) is a propositional formula</li>
                    <li>\(\bot\) is a propositional formula</li>
                    <li>If \(A\) and \(B\) are propositional formulas, then \(A \land B\), \(A \lor B\) and \(A \rightarrow B\) are propositional formulas.</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    You might wonder why we did not include the propositional variables in the alphabet. The ideal is that the language of propositional logic is just fine without any more symbols. We <i>could</i> reason only about formulas without variables such as \(\bot \to (\bot \land (\bot \lor \bot))\). But we want to have more freedom. We want to reason about propositions such as \(\bot \to (\bot \land A)\) and then substitute any proposition for \(A\). One pillar of reasoning in classical propositional logic is that from falsity, everything follows. We express this idea as the proposition \(\bot \to A\) being always true. If we had not propositional variables, we would need to write this rule for every valid string of alphabet such as \(\bot \to (\bot \land \bot)\) or \(\bot \to ((\bot \lor \bot) \land \bot)\) and so on for infinitely many possible strings. That cannot be done with sanity. People who want to be precise or annoing would say that using propositional variable, we work in a <i>meta language</i>, or one level of abstraction higher. The same problem arises when we talk about proofs or even prove theorems about proofs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The alphabet used in the definition of propositional formulas is in some sense complete. But we also use some other symbols as \(\top, \lnot\) or \(\leftrightarrow\) for more clarity. These are just abbreviations. The truth value \(\top\) is an abbreviation of \(\bot \to \bot\), the negation \(\lnot A\) is abbreviation of \(A \to \bot\) and bidirectional implication \(A \leftrightarrow B\) is an abbreviation of ... bidirectional implication \(A \to B \land B \to A\).

                <h2>Deductive systems</h2>
                <h3>Axiomatic systems</h3>
                <p>
                    We now turn to the question of what it means to prove something. There are many deductive systems like axiomatic deductive systems, natural deduction or sequent calculus. We start with an axiomatic system for classical logic. We are given a set of <i>axiom schemas</i> and one rule, the <i>modus ponens</i>.
                </p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>\(A \to (B \to A)\)</li>
                    <li>\( (A \to (B \to C)) \to ((A \to B) \to (A \to C)) \)</li>
                    <li>\(A \to (B \to A \land B)\)</li>
                    <li>\(A \land B \to A\)</li>
                    <li>\(A \land B \to B\)</li>
                    <li>\(A \to (B \lor A)\)</li>
                    <li>\(B \to (B \lor A)\)</li>
                    <li>\( (A \to C) \to (B \to C) \to (A \lor B \to C) \)</li>
                    <li>\(\lnot \lnot A \to A\)</li>
                </ol>
                    
                <p>
                    Axiom schema means that the variables \(A,B\) and \(C\) are not fixed but we can instanteniate them with any formula. For example \(A \to ((C \land D) \to A) \) is a valid use of the first axiom. The modus ponens is a rule which says that if we have formulas \(A \to B\) and \(A\), we can derive \(B\). So how can we prove something? Let's start with assuming \(A \land B\) and we want to prove \(B \land A\).
                <ol>
                    <li>obtain \(A\) using modus ponens with assumption and axiom 4 </li>
                    <li>obtain \(B \to (A \land B)\) using modus ponens with \(A\) and axiom 3</li>
                    <li>obtain \(B\) using modus ponens with assumption and axiom 5 </li>
                    <li>finally obtain conclusion using modus ponens with \(B \to (A \land B)\) and \(B\)</li>
                </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will not bother ourselves with a precise definition of what a proof is. Intuitively proof is what we just did. The set of assumptions is called a context \(\Gamma\) and we say \(A\) is provable from \(\Gamma\) if there exists a proof of \(A\) from \(\Gamma\). We denote this fact as \(\Gamma \vdash A\). This means we can write \(\{A \land B\} \vdash B \land A\). How can we characterize the set of formulas which can be derived from \(\Gamma\)? First any element of the set of assumption is provable from \(\Gamma\). We can also use any axiom schema freely and that means a concrete instantatiation of axiom schema is provable from \(\Gamma\). Lastly everything which was created with the modus ponens rule is again provable from \(\Gamma\). We can state it as a little theorem. We wont prove it, but know that it can be rigorously proved. The important thing is that this theorem gives us the induction principle for proving other theorems about provability relation.
                </p>
                    
                <div class="theorem">
                    Suppose \(\Gamma\) is a set of propositional formulas. The set of formulas (set of consequences) provable from \(\Gamma\) is inductively generated by these rules
                    <ul>
                        <li>If \(A \in \Gamma\), then \(\Gamma \vdash A\)</li>
                        <li>If \(A\) is an axiom schema, then \(\Gamma \vdash A\)</li>
                        <li>If \(\Gamma \vdash A\) and \(\Gamma \vdash A \to B\), then \(\Gamma \vdash B\)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>
                    We are ready to state and prove a more important theorem called the Deduction theorem.
                </p>
                
                <div class="theorem">
                If \(\Gamma \cup \{P\} \vdash Q\) then \(\Gamma \vdash P \to Q\).
                </div>
                
                <p>

                <div class="proof">
                We fix \(\Gamma\) and \(P\) and use the induction on the set of consequences \(\Gamma \cup \{P\}\). This means that if \(Q\) is in the set of consequences, it has the form of one of the three cases mentioned earlier.
                <ol>
                    <li>\(Q \in \Gamma \cup \{P\}\)</li>
                    <li>\(Q\) as an axiom schema</li>
                    <li>There is formula \(C\) such that \(\Gamma \cup \{P\} \vdash C\) and also \(\Gamma \cup \{P\} \vdash C \to Q\)</li>
                </ol>
                
                
                First we deal with the second case. Using the first axiom schema in the form \(Q \to (P \to Q)\) and from modus ponens we obtain \(P \to Q\). Because \(P\) is an axiom schema, we did not need any assumptions. We can write \(\varnothing \vdash P \to Q\) which means we proved it using an empty context. It follows that \(\Gamma \vdash P \to Q\). The first case is tricky. If \(P \in \Gamma\), then we can reuse the prof from the second case. The difference is that \(P\) is an assumption and not an axiom schema. What if \(Q\) is \(P\) itself? We need a rather long proof for this case
                <ol>
                    <li>obtain \(P \to (P \to P)\) as instance of axiom 1 </li>
                    <li>obtain \(P \to ((P \to P) \to P)\) as instance of axiom 1</li>
                    <li>obtain \((P \to ((P \to P) \to P)) \to ((P \to (P \to P)) \to (P \to P))\) as instance of axiom 2</li>
                    <li>obtain \(((P \to (P \to P)) \to P \to P) \) using modus ponens with 2 and 3</li>
                    <li>finally obtain \(P \to P \) using modus ponens with 4 and 1</li>
                </ol>

                This means again that \(\Gamma \vdash P \to Q\). Now we can tackle the third case. We write a proof by induction and we can finally use the induction step in the form \(\Gamma \vdash P \to C\) and \(\Gamma \vdash P \to (C \to Q)\). We use the second axiom schema in the form \(P \to (C \to Q) \to ((P \to C) \to (B \to Q))\) and modus ponens two times to obtain \(P \to Q\) so again \(\Gamma \vdash P \to Q\).
                </p>
                \(\blacksquare\)
                </div>

                <h3>Natural deduction</h3>
                </p>
                    We will now turn our attention to a proof system called natural deduction. It would be nice to have some primitive rules for reasoning instead of these wild axiom schemas. It turns out you can derive few rules from the axiomatic system and proclaim them as the basis for proving. Let's say we fix a context \(\Gamma\) and that we can prove furmulas \(P\) and \(Q\), that is to say \(\Gamma \vdash P\) and \(\Gamma \vdash Q\). We want to show that we can somehow prove \(P \land Q\). This looks so basic that it should be rule and that is indeed the case! If we want to <i>introduce</i> the term \(P \land Q\) and we can prove \(P\) and \(Q\), we simply use the <i>introduction rule</i> for conjuction
                </p>

                $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \qquad \Gamma \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P \land Q} \land_I$$

                <p>
                    The symbol \(\land_I\) says that it is a introduction rule for the conjunction. What about the other way? We have two rules for the <i>elimination</i> of conjunction
                </p>

                $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \land Q}{\Gamma \vdash P} \land_E \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash P \land Q}{\Gamma \vdash Q} \land_E$$

                <p>
                    The introduction rule for implication is really just a differently written deduction theorem and the elimination rule is modus ponens itself! We dont want to pollute the rules with parenthesis so that we will write \(\Gamma \cup \{P\}\) as \(\Gamma, P\).
                </p>

                $$\dfrac{\Gamma,P \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P \to Q} \to_I \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash P \to Q \qquad \Gamma \vdash P}{\Gamma \vdash Q} \land_E$$


                <p>
                    We also have introduction and elimination rules for disjunction. The introduction rules are straightforward
                </p>

                $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P}{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q} \to_I \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q} \to_I$$


                <p>
                    The elimination rule is a little more involved as some of the contexts change in a similar way as it was with the introduction rule for implication.
                </p>

                $$\frac{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q \qquad \Gamma,P \vdash R \qquad \Gamma,Q \vdash R}{\Gamma \vdash R} \lor_E$$

                <p>
                    You may wonder why is the rule written in a such way. Remember that we have an instance of the last axiom schema in a form \((P \to R) \to (Q \to R) \to (P \lor Q \to R)\). We start with two contexts \(\Gamma,P \vdash R\) and \(\Gamma,Q \vdash R\). Using the deduction theorem we obtain \(\Gamma \vdash P \to R\) and \(\Gamma \vdash Q \to R\). Now we use the axiom schema and modus ponens two times to obtain \(\Gamma \vdash R\). There are two other rules we will use. The first is called an <i>assumption rule</i>. With empty context it says that if we assume \(P\), then we are allowed to conclude \(P\). The second rule is a special to classical propositional logic called <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, the elimination rule for the \(\bot\) symbol.
                </p>

                $$\frac{}{\Gamma,P \vdash P} \qquad \frac{\Gamma,(\lnot P) \vdash \bot}{\Gamma \vdash P} \bot_E$$

                <p>
                    It is time for a concrete example. We fix a context \(\Gamma\) and want to retreive the first axiom schema \(B \to (A \to B)\). We start by using the assumption rule to get
                </p>

                $$\dfrac{}{\Gamma,A,B \vdash B}$$

                <p>
                    Now we can use the introduction rule for implication two times and that's it. Because we did not need any concrete context \(\Gamma\), this means the rule \(B \to (A \to B)\) is valid for any context so it is true independently of any other assumptions we make.
                </p>

                $$\dfrac{\dfrac{\dfrac{}{\Gamma,A,B \vdash B}}{\Gamma,B \vdash A \to B} \to_I}{\Gamma \vdash B \to (A \to B)} \to _I$$


                <p>
                    What is meant by a proof in a natural deduction? Proof is any sequence of lines, such as the proof of \(B \to (A \to B)\), which is constructed using natural deduction rules. such sequence is called a <i>sequent</i>. We can also define the set of provable propositions using induction as follows; the set of sequents provable in natural deduction is the smallest set of sequents clused under natural deduction rules. This definition gives us an induction principle which we can use for the following lemma.
                </p>

                <p>
                The theorem about weakening expresses the idea of monotonicity of entailment relation. Suprisingly there are non-monotonic logics where you cannot prove that monotonicity holds. This statement does not have any rule associated with it as we cannot derive it using the introduction and elimination rules. It is called <i>admissible</i> rule. This means that adding this as a <i>rule</i> does not change the set of provable sequents.
                </p>

                <div class="theorem">
                    If \(\Gamma \vdash A\) is provable in natural deduction and \(\Gamma \subset \Delta\), then \(\Delta \vdash A\) is also provable.
                </div>

                <div class="proof">
                    We will use induction on the set of provable sequents. But what does that mean? First we deal with the assumption rule. Suppose we have \(\Gamma,A \vdash A\) and want to prove \(\Delta,A \vdash A\). But we know that \(\Delta,A \vdash A\) holds from the assumption rule alone! Now for the other rules. Lets take for example the introduction rule for conjunction.

                    $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \qquad \Gamma \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P \land Q} \land_I$$

                In order to know that \(\Gamma \vdash A \land B\), we need to assume \(\Gamma \vdash A\) and \(\Gamma \vdash B\). For these to assumptions we use induction step and obtain \(\Delta \vdash A\) and \(\Delta \vdash A\). But now it suffices to use the introduction rule for conjunction and obtian \(\Gamma \vdash A \land B\). Other rule would be checked similarly. This means we proved this theorem.

                <H3>Proof by contradiction</H3>
                <p>
                The proof by contradiction is expressed by the last axiom of the axiomatic system, namely the  \(\lnot \lnot A \to A\). We know that it is just a abbreviation for \(((A \to \bot) \to \bot) \to A\). First we assume that the proposition \(A\) does not hold, \(\lnot A\) and prove nonsense \(\bot\). Then we conclude that \(A\) holds. How do we derive this in natural deduction? First step is to derive \(\bot\). We use the assumption rule two times.

                $$\dfrac{\Gamma, A \vdash A \qquad \Gamma,\lnot A \vdash \lnot A}{\Gamma, A, \lnot A \vdash \bot} \to_E$$

                <p>
                    Notice that we subtly used the weakening theorem in the implication elimination. We had two different contexts \(\Gamma, A\) and \(\Gamma, \lnot A\) and the context in the conclusion is the union of contexts in assumptions! Now we use the introduction rule for implication twice and we are finished.
                </p>

                $$\dfrac{\dfrac{\dfrac{\Gamma, A \vdash A \qquad \Gamma,\lnot A \vdash \lnot A}{\Gamma, A, \lnot A \vdash \bot} \to_E}{\Gamma,A \vdash \lnot \lnot A} \to_I}{\Gamma \vdash A \to \lnot \lnot A}\to_I$$

                <p>
                    Notice that we have not used the elimination rule for \(\bot\). This implication is provable in weaker system of logic, specifically in the so called minimal logic. For the reverse implication we need classical logic as we will use the rule for elimination of \(\bot\). First we again derive nonsense.

                $$\dfrac{\Gamma, \lnot A \vdash \lnot A \qquad \Gamma,\lnot \lnot A \vdash \lnot \lnot A}{\Gamma, \lnot A, \lnot \lnot A \vdash \bot} \to_I$$

                <p>
                    Now we use the elimination rule for \(\bot\) and then the introduction rule for implication and we are finished. This means we proved \(A \leftrightarrow \lnot \lnot A\).

                $$\dfrac{\dfrac{\dfrac{\Gamma, \lnot A \vdash \lnot A \qquad \Gamma,\lnot \lnot A \vdash \lnot \lnot A}{\Gamma, \lnot A, \lnot \lnot A \vdash \bot} \to_I}{\Gamma, \lnot \lnot A \vdash A} \bot_E}{\Gamma \vdash \lnot \lnot A \to A} \to_I$$


                <h3>The law of excluded middle</h3>
                <p>
                    We want to prove \(A \lor \lnot A\). The law of excluded middle is a famous assertion, but how should we prove it? We start with the conclusion a build up the sequents. The first step we take is that we will prove in by contradiction. So we write
                </p>

                $$\frac{\Gamma \vdash \lnot (A \lor \lnot A) \vdash \bot}{\Gamma \vdash A \lor \lnot A} \bot_E$$

                <p>
                    Modus ponens gets us so far.
                </p>

                $$\dfrac{\textcolor{red}{\Gamma, \lnot(A \lor \lnot A) \vdash A \lor \lnot A} \qquad \Gamma, \lnot(A \lor \lnot A) \vdash\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)}{\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash \lnot (A \lor \lnot A) \vdash \bot}{\Gamma \vdash A \lor \lnot A} \bot_E} \to_I$$

                <p>
                    We know that the right part of implication follows from assumption rule. But can we prove the left part? We use the disjuntion introduction to make it simpler. this means we need to prove \(\Gamma, \lnot(A \lor \lnot A) \vdash \lnot A\). We use proof by contrdiction again and get
                </p>
                
                $$\dfrac{\Gamma, \lnot \lnot A, \lnot(A \lor \lnot A) \vdash \bot}{\Gamma, \lnot(A \lor \lnot A) \vdash \lnot A} \bot_E$$

                <p>
                    The next step is to remember that we know \(\Gamma, \lnot \lnot A \vdash A\) as we proved it in the previous chapter. We use introduction rule for disjuntion to obtain
                </p>

                $$\dfrac{\Gamma, \lnot \lnot A \vdash A}{\Gamma, \lnot \lnot A \vdash A \lor \lnot A} \lor_I$$

                <p>
                  This means we know how to prove the red part  
                </p>
