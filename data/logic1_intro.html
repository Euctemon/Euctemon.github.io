                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                    What is logic? What does it mean when someone says he or she is a logical person? If you ask people what constitutes a logical person, you get various answers. You might hear that such a person is attentive, communicates effectively, and avoids using vague or ambiguous language. It means that the person tries to ensure that his or her ideas are clear and supported by facts. Words are properly matched to ideas and ideas to facts. Synonyms to the word logical are for example clear, reasonable, sound, consistent or valid.

                    Logic can be described as a study of correct reasoning, and it is a big topic in philosophy. It might come as a surprise that mathematicians do not know about logic as much as you would think. They need to know how to reason correctly, but very few mathematicians study logic directly. Those who do are interested in so-called mathematical logic. This branch of mathematics can be roughly divided into the study of sets, the study of the structure of proofs, and the study of the relationship between formal theories. During my undergraduate studies, I had two courses on logic. One was an introductory course, and the other one was on the computational aspects of logic, or in other words, how can we leverage logic to solve concrete problems? Apart from that, we were taught how to deal with quantifiers, how to structure a proof by contradiction, and a few other tools applicable in mathematics.

                    The purpose of these notes is to organise my thoughts I collected throughout my studies and maybe get a little farther in understanding logic. Apart from lecture notes, this text is heavily influenced by an awesome book called <i>Mathematical Logic and Computation</i> by Jeremy Avigad. You shouldn't use these notes for studying mathematical logic, as I try to look at a few things in a not-so-standard way.
