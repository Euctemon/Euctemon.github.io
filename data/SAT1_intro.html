                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This topic is about the so called SAT solvers. A SAT solver is a program which aims to solve the <i>Boolean satisfiability problem</i>. Let's say we have a formula \(P \land (Q \lor R)\) and we want to assign 1 or 0 to the variables such that the whole expression evaluates to 1. Those who know something about logic will easily guess some solution. For example \(P \to 1, Q \to 1\) and \(R \to 0\) is a valid solution to this problem. This is because \(1 \lor 0\) evaluates to \(1\) and \(1 \land 1\) evaluates to \(1\) too.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Why do we know that these logical connectives are evaluated in such a way? In order to be able to evaluate a proposition, we need some ground rules for the evaluation process. And for that we need to know what a proposition is. The first chapter deals with the classical propositional logic, its rules and structure. I also explore few interesting things like the proof of contradiction of the law of excluded middle. The second chapter is concerned with soundness and completeness of propositional logic.  This sheds a light on why would we want to desing a SAT solver at all as it deals with the connection between evaluation a provability. After these chapters we will be ready to actually start programming a SAT solver.

                    <i>The part about logic is heavily guided by the awesome book called Mathematical logic and computation by Jeremy Avigad. The book discussed many topics in logic and also computation but we will only delve into the realm of propositional logic.</i>
