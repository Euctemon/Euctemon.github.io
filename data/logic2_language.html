            <h2>Languages</h2>

            <p>
                In the introduction, we noted that logic is concerned with the problem of correct ways of reasoning. Informal logic deals with critical thinking, unravelling fallacies, and constructing sound arguments in natural language. Mathematicians are not brave enough to tackle this problem in its full generality and leave it to philosophers and linguists. They turn their attention to formal logic and formal languages. Such languages have strict rules, which enable unambiguous interpretation. Let's take the law of excluded middle as an example. Philosophers debate whether it should or should not be a law. Mathematicians either involve such a statement in the formal system or not.
            </p>

            <p>
                One way mathematicians use logic is to express ideas in other mathematical branches such as analysis or algebra. Almost every statement in mathematics involves quantifiers or logical connectives, and mathematicians need to be able to work with such statements. But they also use logic to study the structure of mathematics. For example, one can study the structure, length, or complexity of proofs. In this way mathematicians use logic to study logic. In a broad sense, we are concerned with two things in mathematical logic. The first one is building new things out of old ones. We do this using the concept of a function. The second one is describing connections between chosen things. We do this using the concept of a relation. These two things is all we need for a definition of a
            </p>

            <div class="definition">
                A <b>language</b> is a triple \(\mathcal{L} = (\Gamma, \Delta, \Alpha) \) where 
                
                <ul>
                    <li>\(\Gamma\) is a set of function symbols</li>
                    <li>\(\Delta\) is a set of relation symbols</li>
                    <li>\(\Alpha\) is a function assigning a natural number to every function and relation symbol</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                This doesn't look like a language at all. If you ask a linguist, they will shake their head over this definition. The triple \((\Gamma, \Delta, \Alpha)\) contains the so-called non-logical symbols, which we want to include in our theory. It also includes a function \(\Alpha\) called the arity function. Its domain is the set \(\Gamma \cup \Delta\) and its codomain is the set \(\mathbb{N}\). The arity function simply describes the number of symbols the function or relation works with. In this sense, it is a form of a language that we use to describe mathematical structures. Another common name for this triple is a signature, which is perhaps more fitting. For alphabet \(\Sigma\) we use distinct symbols called variables, parentheses, and a comma. This means that given variables \(\alpha,\beta\) and a function symbol \(f\) of arity two, we can construct a word \(f(\alpha,\beta)\). What is the general way of constructing words, or as a mathematician would say, terms?
            </p>

            <div class="definition">
                Let \(\mathcal{L} = (\Gamma, \Delta, \Alpha)\) be a language. The set of <b>terms</b> of \(\mathcal{L}\) is the smallest set of strings over the alphabet \(\Sigma\) satisfying the following
                <ul>
                    <li>If \(x\) is a variable, then \(x\) is a term</li>
                    <li>If \(c\) is a constant function symbol, then \(c\) is a term</li>
                    <li>If \(f\) is a function symbol of arity \(n\) and \(t_1,\ldots,t_n\) are all terms, then \(f(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) is a term</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                What are some simple languages? The simplest language has no function or relation symbols at all. We can write such language as \(\mathcal{L}_\varnothing = (\varnothing, \varnothing, \Alpha)\) where \(\varnothing\) is the empty set. If you wonder whether the function \(\Alpha\) is well defined, then don't worry. It's perfectly fine to have a function with the empty set as its domain. So what are the terms of \(\mathcal{L}_\varnothing\)? The only way to build terms in this language is from variables. This means that terms of \(\mathcal{L}_\varnothing\) over a given alphabet \(\Sigma\) are exactly the variables of \(\Sigma\). If the alphabet does not contain any variables, then there are no terms. Notice that in order to use a language, we need to specify the underlying alphabet!
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's make the language a little more interesting. We will write \(\mathcal{L}_1\) for a language where the only function symbol is \(f\) with arity one and the only relation symbol is \(r\) with arity two. In this language the arity function is defined as \(\Alpha(f) = 1\) and \(\Alpha(r) = 2\). To talk about terms, we need to specify the alphabet. For example, the alphabet \(\Sigma_1\) containing only one variable \(\alpha\) is a nice alphabet. Having specified language and alphabet, we can start to write down the terms. For example, \(\alpha\) or \(f(f(\alpha))\) are both terms of this language. If we abbreviate \(f ( \cdots f(\alpha))\) as \(f^n(\alpha)\), meaning we applied \(f\) exactly \(n\) times, then it is not hard to see that every term has the form \(f^n(\alpha)\) for some natural number \(n\). In the case of zero, we declare that \(f^0(\alpha)\) means \(\alpha\).
            </p>
                
            <h2>Model theory</h2>
            <p>
                A function can be thought of as a recipe for modifying old things or creating new things out of old ones. For example squaring a number is a function. Another example might be a cooking recipe, where the input are the ingredients and the output is a sweet pie of your choosing. On the other hand relations express a connection between things. For example two people might be relatives, friends or colleagues. In all these examples these people are in some kind of relationship. How do we represent relations in mathematics? First we choose a set of things we want to talk about. Let's say that the set \(A = \{\text{Anne},\text{John},\text{Eva},\text{Timothy}, \text{Hans}\}\) represents all the people in a company. The set \(B = \{\text{Eva},\text{Timothy}\}\) then defines a relation on the set \(A\).
            </p>

            <p>
                What is interesting is that we can write a function \(f\) which specifies how to choose the set \(B\) from the set \(A\). The function \(f\) is simply defined as \(f(\text{Eva}) = \top\), \(f(\text{Timothy}) = \top\) and \(\bot\) otherwise. You can thing about the values \(\top\) and \(\bot\) as indicators wheter the person belongs to the set \(B\). 
            </p>    
               
            <div class="note">
                When dealing with boolean formulas, symbols \(\bold{1}\) and \(\bold{0}\) are commonly used. 
            </div>

            <p>
                How is this connected to logic? In logic we are interested which statements are true and we express the idea of truth using relations. Every statement, which is related to another true statement, is also true. We first choose few axioms which are in this truth set by definition and then try to come up with another true statemens by means of building statements from these axioms. You maybe wonder why do we need relations if we can just use the function \(f\) to express the relation. I have heard that some logicians actually use only functions. The point of relations is that relations are not just some functions, but functions assigning truth values. We therefore seclude this kind of functions from the function set \(\Gamma\) as it helps us to see which functions are doing something special.
            </p>

            <p>
                We already know how to build terms consisting of variables and functions. How can we combine terms with relations? The answer to that questin is given by the following definition. We start with the definition of atomic formulas, which are formulas without the so-called logical connectives. We will deal with logical connectives later.
            </p>

            <div class="definition">
                Let \(\mathcal{L} = (\Gamma, \Delta, \Alpha)\) be a language. The set of <b>atomic formulas</b> of \(\mathcal{L}\) is the smallest set of strings over the alphabet \(\Sigma\) satisfying the following
                <ul>
                    <li>If \(r\) is a relation symbol of arity \(n\) and \(t_1,\ldots,t_n\) are all terms, then \(r(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) is an atomic formula</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
                The last two paragraps were little misleading. Both the definitions of terms and formulas use function symbols and relation symbols. Why do we use function and relation symbols? The reason is that we want to have the freedom to specify the actual functions and relations later. Think about it as some kind of templates or interfaces in programming languages. When declaring a language \(\mathcal{L}\), you define the arity of function symbol \(f\) to be two, but you do not have to say whether the function symbol \(f\) represents addition or multiplication. The process of specifying the concrete implementation of language symbols is connected to an idea of a model.
            </p>

            <div class="definition">
            Fix a language \(\mathcal{L} = (\Gamma,\Delta,\Alpha)\). We say that \(\mathcal{M} = (U,I)\) is a <b>model</b> for language \(\mathcal{L}\) if the set \(U\), commonly called the universe, is a nonempty set and \(I\) is a function which assigns to each k-ary function symbol in \(\Gamma\) a k-ary function from \(U\) to \(U\) and to each k-ary relation symbol in \(\Delta\) a k-ary relation on \(U\).
            </div>

            <p>
                Let's take again the language \(\mathcal{L}_1\) defined like
                <span class="popover">this
                    <span>This language has one function symbol \(f\) and one relation symbol \(r\), where \(\Alpha(f) = 1\) and \(\Alpha(r) = 2\).</span>
                </span>
                and a universe \(U\) consisting of natural numbers. We will define two models for this language. Both models will interpret the function symbol \(f\) as adding a fixed natural number to the function's operand. The model \(\mathcal{M}_1\) will interpret the relation symbol as the greater or equal relation and the second model \(\mathcal{M}_2\) will interpret the relation symbol as the divisibility relation. We can write these models as \(\mathcal{M}_1 = (\mathbb{N}, \mathcal{I}_1)\) and \(\mathcal{M}_2 = (\mathbb{N}, \mathcal{I}_2)\) where

                $$ \mathcal{I}_1(f) = (+1) \quad \text{and} \quad \mathcal{I}_1(r) = (\geq), $$

                $$ \mathcal{I}_2(f) = (+3) \quad \text{and} \quad \mathcal{I}_2(r) = (\: | \:). $$
            </p>

            

            <p>
                Although these models share the same language, they interpret the language in different ways. For example we have \(4 \geq 3\), but not \(4 \:|\: 3\). This shows that things which are true in one model might not necessarily be true in another. But what does it mean that \(4 \geq 3\) is true in \(\mathcal{M}_1\)? Answering this question is not easy at all. One of the atomic formulas in the \(\mathcal{L}_1\) language looks like \(r(f(f(a)),b)\). We can partially interpret this formula in the model \(\mathcal{M}_2\) as \(a+2\:|\:b\). Is this statement true? Well it depends how we interpret the variables right? For example \(2 + 2 \:|\: 8\) is a true statement, but \(1 + 2 \:|\: 4\) is not. The transition from variables to elements of a concrete universe is expressed by the assignment function.
            </p>

            <div class="definition">
                Fix a alphabet \(\Sigma\). The assignment function \(v\) is a function from the set of variables in \(\Sigma\) to the universe \(U\).
            </div>

            <p>
                Fix an atomic formula \(\mathfrak{f}\). This is just some relation symbol \(r\) populated with terms. We can use the assignment function \(v\) model function \(I\) to assign all variables to elements of a universe and all symbols to concrete functions and relations. We then check, whether the resulting expression is in the set given by the intepretation of \(r\) in the model. For example we assign an expression \(3 + 2 \:|\: 4\) to an atomic formula \(\mathfrak{f}\) given by \(r(f(f(a)),b)\). The expression can be then simplified to \(5 \:|\: 3\). We used the model \(\mathcal{M}_2\) and the assignment function \(v\), where \(v(a) = 3\) and \(v(b) = 4\). The model \(\mathcal{M}_2\) contains the function \(I\) which interprets the relation symbol \(r\) to a relation \((\:|\:)\). So for a given universe of natural numbers we have the following interepretation

                $$ (\:|\:) = \{\{1,1\},\{1,2\}, \{3,12\},\ldots \}. $$

                Remember that earlier we talked about how relation is really a subset of some set. We then think about this subset as the set we want to label true. The set \((\:|\:)\) does not contain the set \(\{5,3\}\), or in infix notation \(5 \:|\: 3\), which means the formula \(\mathfrak{f}\) is not true under the speficic model and specific assignment.
            </p>

            <div class="definition">
                We say that the atomic formula \(\mathfrak{f}\) is <b>satisfiable</b> in the model \(\mathcal{M}\) if there exists an assignment that renders the formula true. We write this as \(\mathcal{M} \vDash \mathfrak{f}[v]\).
            </div>

            <p>
                Some formulas are satisfiable by all assignments. For example the formula \(r(x,x)\) is satisfiable in both models by all natural numbers as every natural number is greater or equal than itself and divides itself. We call such formulas as true.
            </p>

            <div class="definition">
                We say that the atomic formula \(\mathfrak{f}\) is <b>true</b> in the model \(\mathcal{M}\) if every assignment renders the formula true. We write this as \(\mathcal{M} \vDash \mathfrak{f}\).
            </div>

            <p>
                Finally it could happen that some exeptional formulas are true in every model for a fixed language.
            </p>

            <div class="definition">
                We say that the atomic formula \(\mathfrak{f}\) is a <b>semantic tautology</b> if it is true in every model for a given language \(\mathcal{L}\). We write this as \(\: \vDash \mathfrak{f}\) or as \(\large \varnothing \normalsize \vDash \mathfrak{f}\).
            </div>

            <p>
                Let's think whether there are any tautologies between atomic formulas. Fix a language \(\mathcal{L}\) and suppose there is a model \(\mathcal{M}\) and formula \(\mathfrak{f}\) such that \(\mathcal{M} \vDash \mathfrak{f}\). \(\large \varnothing\) \(\varnothing\)
