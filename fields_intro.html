                    Fields are an important object in mathematics. In abstract algebra one can study various connections between groups and fields which is for example helpful for reasoning about the possibility to find roots of a polynomial. More down to earth usage of fields is when one needs to solve a system of linear algebraic equations. The coefficients by the unknowns must be from a field. Why is that? Let's look at an example
                </p>

                $$\begin{aligned}
                3x+2y&=1 \\
                x-y&=2 \\
                \end{aligned}$$

                <p>
                    What do we do when we try to solve this system of equations? First we move the \(y\) to the other side of the equation with an opposite sign to get \(x=2+y\). We substitute this expression to the first equation to obtain \(3(2+y)+2y=1\). We multiply the content in the brackets to get \((6+3y)+2y=1\). We move the brackets to obtain \(6+(3y+2y)\) and add the coefficients for the variable \(y\) to get \(6+5y=1\). We subtract the number 6 from both sides and divide by the number \(5\) to find out that \(y=-1\). We substitute the result to the second equation to get \(x=1\). We used a lot of properties of numbers to arrive at this result. We freely used associativity of adding, the distributive property, existence of additive and multiplicative inverses and so on. How does a formal definition of fields look like? It is not pretty as a field is quite a complex algebraic structure. A lot of us needed to learn the propertis like associativity or distributivity of rationals or real numbers during math classes in highschool. Here is the definition

                        Field is a set \(R\) with two binary operations \(\odot : R \rightarrow R \rightarrow R\) and \(\oplus : R \rightarrow R \rightarrow R\) and two distinct elements \(1 \in R\) and \(0 \in R\) such that they satisfy following axioms
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>\(\forall \, a,b,c \in R\) it follows that \((a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c)\)</li>
                        <li>\(\forall \, a \in R\) it follows that \(a \oplus 0 = a\)</li>
                        <li>\(\forall \, a \in R \enspace \exists \, b \in R\) such that \(a \oplus b = 0\)</li>

                        <li>\(\forall \, a,b,c \in R\) it follows that \(a \odot (b \oplus c) = a \odot b \oplus a \odot c\)</li>

                    This is a long list of properties and it might be hard to remember them if one does not use them often. From the next chapter we will be building the field structure a little bit differently and will be encoding it in a theorem prover called LEAN which is a software for writing mathematical definitions, theorems and proofs as programs. In the next chapter I will start formalizing monoids and groups both "on paper" and in LEAN. If you do not care about the programming side of these notes you can just read the text and skip the code snippets.

                <p>
                    It is not in my power and my knowledge to introduce you to LEAN so that you can instantly grab a computer and start proving. If you really want to try fiddle with LEAN then you can go to <a href="https://lean-lang.org/">LEAN official site</a> which contains a help on how to start. You find few tutorials on that web too and <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/index.html">Mathematics in LEAN</a> is the best choice for ... mathematics. There is also other software designed for theorem proving like Isabelle, Coq or Prover9. I like LEAN because apart from being a theorem prover it is also a beatiful functional language.
