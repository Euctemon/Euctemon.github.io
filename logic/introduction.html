            <h1>Mathematical logic</h1>
            <p>The following pages are about mathematical logic. During my engineering studies, I wasn't concerned about
                logic at all. After I finished mechanical engineering, I went to study pure mathematics. For my bachelor
                thesis I chose to prove a theorem from algebra in a theorem prover. Theorem provers are programs for
                proving mathematical statements, and they rely heavily on logic. I got acquainted with some not-so-known
                types of logic systems and how they are used in theorem proving. I soon discovered that I had not
                understood mathematical logic at all. Why is first order logic so ubiquous? Why do we care about truth
                tables and how do they interact with propositional logic? Why do most theorem provers use higher order
                logic? There are so many interesting question connected to logic. I don't think my undestanding got much
                better since I started learning about these things. Nevertheless, I wanted to put down some of my
                thoughts on logic here, hoping that writing about it would make at least some ideas clear.</p>
