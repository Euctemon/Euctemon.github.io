            <h1>Other systems of logic</h1>
            <h2>Natural deduction</h2>
            <p>The Hilbert style is not the only way to set up a logic system. The axiomatic systems have mainly axioms
                and only one rule. What if we had only one axiom and many rules? It turns out that such a system exists.
                The idea is to reason about the alphabet and not about whole propositions. Let's look at the
                conjunction. The Hilbert system had an axiom which <em>introduces</em> the proposition involving
                conjunction, namely the third axiom \(A \to (B \to (A \land B))\). If, for some context \(\Gamma\), we
                know that \(\Gamma \vdash A\) and \(\Gamma \vdash B\), we can use modus ponens two times to obtain
                \(\Gamma \vdash A \land B\). It would be nice to have some kind of rule which would build the
                conjunction out of its parts, something like</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash A \qquad \Gamma \vdash B}{\Gamma \vdash A \land B}$$</p>
            <p>The part above the line describes what we assume and the lower part describes what we can build out of
                the assumptions. This is in agreement with the axiom schema where the modus ponens is built into the
                introduction rule itself. We can also break apart the conjunction. This is what the fourth and fifth
                axiom schemas tell us. In order to completely describe the behaviour of conjunction, we need one
                introduction rule and two elimination rules.</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \qquad \Gamma \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P \land Q} \land_I \qquad \dfrac{\Gamma
                \vdash P \land Q}{\Gamma \vdash P} \land_E \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash P \land Q}{\Gamma \vdash Q}
                \land_E$$</p>
            <p>The implication has one introductory rule and one elimination rule. The elimination rule is exactly modus
                ponens. If you had not seen the Deduction theorem, the introduction rule might seem surprising. But when
                you think about the Deduction theorem, it really <em>is</em> a way to introduce implication. Note how
                the context is changed from \(\Gamma,P\) to \(\Gamma\).</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P \to Q} \to_I \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash P \to Q
                \qquad \Gamma \vdash P}{\Gamma \vdash Q} \to_E$$</p>
            <p>Next logical connective is the disjunction. The two introduction rules are modelled according to the
                sixth and seventh axiom. The elimination rule mirrors the eighth axiom and is also a context-changing
                rule.</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P}{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q} \lor_I \qquad \dfrac{\Gamma \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P
                \lor Q} \lor_I \qquad \dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q \qquad \Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash R \qquad \Gamma
                \cup\{Q\} \vdash R}{\Gamma \vdash R} \lor_E$$</p>
            <p>The next rule mirrors the ninth axiom schema and is called reductio ad absurdum. After introducing all
                rules for natural deduction, we will say something more about this rule.</p>
            <p>$$\frac{\Gamma \cup\{\lnot P\} \vdash \bot}{\Gamma \vdash P} \bot_E$$</p>
            <p>The last rule is called the assumption rule. Remember that we proved \(P \to P\) from the first two axiom
                schemas. There is nothing above the line which means we do not have to assume anything to use this rule,
                this is the rule for introducing assumptions.</p>
            <p>$$\frac{} {\Gamma,P \vdash P}$$</p>
            <p>It seems that we encoded all the axiom schemas into introduction or elimination rules but the first two.
                Our first task will be to construct a proof of the first axiom in the style of natural deduction. First
                we use the assumption rule with context \(\Gamma \cup\{B\}\) and proposition \(A\).</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{} {\Gamma \cup\{A,B\} \vdash A}$$</p>
            <p>Using the introduction rule for implication twice, we recover the first axiom schema!</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\dfrac{\dfrac{} {\Gamma \cup\{A,B\} \vdash A}} {\Gamma \cup\{A\} \vdash B \to A} \to_I} {\Gamma
                \vdash A \to (B \to A)} \to_I$$</p>
            <p>We just wrote our first proof using the natural deduction system. We could also recover the second rule.
                We already know what is meant by a proof in axiomatic system. The notion of proof in natural deduction
                is not much different. The pair \( (\Gamma,A) \) is called a <em>sequent</em> where \(\Gamma\) is a
                finite set of propositions and we write \(\Gamma \vdash A\). A proof is then a sequence of sequents in
                which every sequent is obtained from the previous using elimination or introduction rule, apart from the
                assumption rule.</p>
            <div class="definition">
                <p>The set of sequents provable in natural deduction is defined as the smallest set of sequents closed
                    under the natural deduction rules.</p>
            </div>
            <p>One such use of induction in natural deduction system is the following lemma called <b>Weakening</b>. It
                expresses that the natural deduction is a monotone system. In other words, adding a hypothesis does not
                destroy propositions which were earlier provable.</p>
            <div class="theorem">
                <p>If \(\Gamma \vdash A\) is provable in natural deduction and \(\Gamma \subset \Delta\), then \(\Delta
                    \vdash A\) is provable in natural deduction.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="proof">
                <p>We will use induction on the set of provable sequents. But what does that mean? First we deal with
                    the assumption rule. Suppose we know that \(\Gamma \cup\{A\} \vdash A\) is provable and want to
                    prove \(\Delta \cup\{A\} \vdash A\). But we know that \(\Delta \cup\{A\} \vdash A\) holds from the
                    assumption rule alone. What about the other rules? Let's take for example the introduction rule for
                    conjunction.</p>
                <p>$$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \qquad \Gamma \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P \land Q} \land_I$$</p>
                <p>Let's say that \(\Gamma \vdash A \land B\) is provable. This requires that \(\Gamma \vdash A\) and
                    \(\Gamma \vdash B\) are provable too. The induction principle tells us that we can use the theorem
                    statement for the upper part of the introduction or elimination rule. For the case of introduction
                    rule for conjunction, this means we assume that \(\Delta \vdash A\) and \(\Delta \vdash B\) are
                    provable. Using the introduction rule we conclude that also \(\Delta \vdash A \land B\) is provable.
                    Other rules would be checked in the same manner and we would find that all of them respect the
                    provability relation. This means we proved the theorem. If \(\Gamma \vdash A\), then \(\Delta \vdash
                    A\).</p>
                <p>\(\blacksquare\)</p>
            </div>
            <p>This is not a rule as the introduction or elimination rules we have seen so far. We cannot derive this
                rule using other rules. It is called an admissible rule which means it does not change the set of
                provable sequents. We could work without it, but it is pleasant to use. For example we can have a more
                general form of rules we introduced so far</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash A \qquad \Delta \vdash B}{\Gamma \cup \Delta \vdash A \land B}$$</p>
            <p>You might have been bothered by the form of the elimination rule for disjunction. The axiom schema has
                the form of explicit implications, \((A \to C) \to (B \to C) \to (A \lor B \to C)\), but the rule is
                written without implications. The question is, are these two rules equivalent?</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q \qquad \Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash R \qquad \Gamma \cup\{Q\} \vdash R}{\Gamma
                \vdash R} \lor_E$$</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q \qquad \Gamma \vdash P \to R \qquad \Gamma \vdash Q \to R}{\Gamma \vdash
                R} \lor_E$$</p>
            <p>Let's say we know that \(\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q\) and \(\Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash R\) and \(\Gamma
                \cup\{Q\} \vdash R\) are provable. Using introduction rule for implication we obtain \(\Gamma \vdash P
                \to R\) and \(\Gamma \vdash Q \to R\). We can use the second form to conclude that \(\Gamma \vdash R\).
                What about the other way? Assume we know that \(\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q\) and \(\Gamma \vdash P \to R\)
                and \(\Gamma \vdash Q \to R\) are provable. How can we use the first form of the rule? We use the
                weakening property to obtain \(\Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash P \to R\) and \(\Gamma \cup\{Q\} \vdash Q \to
                R\). From the assumption rule we know that \(\Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash P\) and \(\Gamma \cup\{Q\} \vdash
                Q\). Using introduction rule for implication we finally obtain \(\Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash R\) and
                \(\Gamma \cup\{Q\} \vdash R\) and we can use the first form of the rule to conclude that \(\Gamma \vdash
                R\). This means that the weakening theorem tells us these rules are equivalent! One last remark. We
                could write the weakening as a rule operating on context</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P}{\Gamma \cup\{A\} \vdash P} w_I$$</p>
            <h2>Proof by contradiction</h2>
            <p>It might come as a surprise that propositional logic has a few subtypes. The most known is the classical
                propositional logic. Such logic is described by the nine axiom schemas we saw earlier, or the
                corresponding natural deduction rules. Taking only the first eight axiom schemas would mean we work in
                minimal propositional logic and replacing the last axiom schema with \(\bot \to A\) would mean we work
                in intuitionistic propositional logic. The axiom schema \(\lnot \lnot A \to A\) is called double
                negation elimination. First task is to recover the double negation elimination axiom from the
                elimination rule for \(\bot\). We can happily prove falsity using implication elimination rule from two
                simple assumptions.</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\dfrac{} {\{\lnot A\} \vdash \lnot A} \qquad \dfrac{} {\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash \lnot \lnot A}}
                {\{\lnot A, \lnot \lnot A\} \vdash \bot} \to_I$$</p>
            <p>Note the lines above the assumptions. This means we needed to use the assumption rule. The second step is
                to use the elimination rule for \(\bot\) called reduction ad absurdum. After that we use the
                introduction rule for implication and we are done.</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\dfrac{} {\{\lnot A\} \vdash \lnot A} \qquad \dfrac{} {\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash \lnot \lnot A}}
                {\dfrac{\{\lnot A, \lnot \lnot A\} \vdash \bot}{\dfrac{\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A}{\varnothing \vdash
                \lnot \lnot A \to A} \to_I} \bot_E} \to_E$$</p>
            <p>The reverse implication is similar, but we do not have to use the elimination rule for \(\bot\). This has
                the consequence that the reverse implication is provable in minimal propositional logic. We again start
                with proving falsity.</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\dfrac{} {\{A\} \vdash A} \qquad \dfrac{} {\{\lnot A\} \vdash \lnot A}} {\{A, \lnot A\} \vdash
                \bot} \to_E$$</p>
            <p>Two introduction rules for implications are enough to conclude the desired proposition. In classical
                logic we therefore have the equivalence \(A \leftrightarrow \lnot \lnot A\).</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\dfrac{} {\{A\} \vdash A} \qquad \dfrac{} {\{\lnot A\} \vdash \lnot A}} {\dfrac{\{A, \lnot A\}
                \vdash \bot}{\dfrac{\{A\} \vdash \lnot A \to \bot}{\varnothing \vdash A \to \lnot \lnot A} \to_I} \to_I}
                \to_E$$</p>
            <h2>The law of excluded middle</h2>
            <p>Another famous thing in logic is the law of excluded middle. It says that the proposition \(P \lor \lnot
                P\) is true without any further assumptions. The proof is tricky and not intuitive at all. Let's start
                at the end. In order to prove \(P \lor \lnot P\) we use reductio ad absurdum.</p>
            <p>$$\frac{\varnothing\vdash \lnot (A \lor \lnot A) \vdash \bot}{\varnothing \vdash A \lor \lnot A} \bot_E$$
            </p>
            <p>After that we use modus ponens (elimination rule for implication). The right side can be proved by the
                assumption rule immediately. The problem is with the left side colored in red.</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\dfrac{\vdots}{\textcolor{red}{\{\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)\} \vdash A \lor \lnot A}} \qquad \dfrac{}
                {\{\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)\} \vdash\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)}}{\dfrac{\varnothing \vdash \lnot (A \lor \lnot
                A) \vdash \bot}{\varnothing \vdash A \lor \lnot A} \bot_E} \to_E$$</p>
            <p>We only need to prove one part of the disjunction thanks to the introduction rule for disjunction. If you
                try to come up with the proof, you would have to try which part is provable. I will reveal that choosing
                to prove \(\lnot A\) is the right way. The next step is to use reductio ad absurdum again and modus
                ponens. The left part follows from the assumption rule.</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\dfrac{} {\{\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)\} \vdash \lnot(A \lor \lnot A)} \qquad
                \dfrac{\vdots}{\color{red}{\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A \lor \lnot A}}}{\dfrac{\{\lnot \lnot A,\lnot(A
                \lor \lnot A)\} \vdash \bot}{\dfrac{\{\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)\} \vdash \lnot A}{\color{red}{\{\lnot(A \lor
                \lnot A)\} \vdash A \lor \lnot A}} \lor_I} \bot_E} \to_E$$</p>
            <p>The right part seems even worse than what we have to prove but don't worry. Knowing \(\lnot \lnot A
                \vdash A\) we can use introduction rule for disjunction to quickly finish the proof.</p>
            <p>$$\dfrac{\dfrac{} {\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A} \vdash}{\color{red}{\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A \lor \lnot
                A}} \lor_I$$</p>
            <p>The provability of \(\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A\) does not follow from the assumption rule but had to be
                proved. That is why I added the symbol \(\vdash\) next to the line. It is not an official rule but it is
                quite reasonable to write it this way. Remember that the symbol \(\vdash\) stands for provability. It
                makes sense to have a kind of introduction rule for statements we have already proved. We do this in
                mathematics all the time. We start by proving small lemmas and then use them to make bigger ones until
                we end up with rather complex theorems. It resembles the structural rule for weakening as we act on the
                structure of the proof. Of course we could simply copy the whole proof of \(\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A\)
                here.</p>
