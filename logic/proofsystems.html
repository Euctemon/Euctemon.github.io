            <h1>Writing proofs</h1>
            <h2>Axiomatic systems</h2>
            <p>In the previous chapter, we discussed a way how to check satisfiability of a formula in a given language.
                We noted that for an infinite model, the truth tables come short. So what do mathematicians do instead?
                They write proofs. A proof is essentially a sequence of formulas. We start with the so called axioms and
                then use rules for constructing new formulas out of old ones, hoping that at the end we derive the
                formula we want to prove. The rules are commonly know as inference rules and together with set of axioms
                constitute an axiomatic system.</p>
            <p>Axiomatic systems have a long history. Using set of axioms and inference rules dates back to Euclid and
                his elements. Euclid called the axioms of geometry as postulates. But the proper study of axiomatic
                systems can be said to begin with Frege and Hilbert. They were not only using logic for mathematics, but
                they were interested in the axiomatic systems itself. What follows is a version of an axiomatic system
                for propositional logic Hilbert was using.</p>

                    <li>\(\lnot \lnot \mathfrak{a} \to \mathfrak{a}\)</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div><span class="proof-word">Rules</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>If we can prove \(\mathfrak{a}\) and \(\mathfrak{a} \to \mathfrak{b}\), we can prove
                        \(\mathfrak{b}\).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>We see that Hilbert's axiomatic system has only one rule called modus ponens. Philosophers use this
                implication rule for many types of logic and they sometimes call it modul ponendo ponens. This can be
                translated as <i>method that by affirming, affirms</i>. The rules we use for producing new formulas out
                of the proven ones are called inference rules, because we infer new things from old ones and the axioms
                are often called axiom schemas. This is because \(\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}\) and \(\mathfrak{c}\) are
                not concrete formulas, but rather symbols which can be substitued for any formula we want. We can for
                example instatiate the first axiom schema as \(p \to (q \to p)\) or \((p \land q) \to ((r \lor s) \to (p
                \land q))\) where \(p, q, r\) and \(s\) are variables for the propositional logic.</p>
            <p>The interesting thing is that these axiom schemata were chosen so that every one of them produce
                tautology. You can check that with truth tables. Before we look at how we use such axiomatic system, we
                write down the definition of a proof. This definition is used for any language and not just for the
                language of propositional logic.</p>
            <div class="definition"><span class="proof-word">Proof</span> is a sequence \(\Psi_0,\ldots,\Psi_n\) of
                formulas such that for every \(k &lt; n + 1\), either \(\Psi_k\) is a formula in context \(\Gamma\), an
                axiom schema or there are indices \(i_0,\ldots,i_l&lt; k\) such that \(\Psi_k\) follow from
                \(\Psi_{i_0}, \ldots, \Psi_{i_l}\) by some inference rule. We say that \(\Psi_n\) is the conclusion and
                the sequence \(\Psi_0,\ldots,\Psi_n\) with hypotheses in \(\Gamma\) is a proof of \(\Psi_n\). We write
                \(\Gamma \vdash \Psi\) if there exists a proof of \(\Psi\) given the context \(\Gamma\).</div>
            <p>We notice that the definition features something called context. This is a set of formulas which we
                suppose are true in the context of a given proof. It is not always the case that \(p \lor q\) is true,
                but we can add it to the context and then build proofs upon this assumption. Suppose we choose a context
                made of \(c \lor b\), \(c \to d\) and \(b \to d\). The variable \(c\) stands for car, \(b\) for bus and
                \(d\) for staying dry.</p>
            <div class="theorem">\(\{c \lor b, c \to d, b \to d\} \vdash d\).</div>

                    <li>Obtain \((b \lor c) \to d\) by modus ponens using the context formula \(c \to d\) and the
                        formula obtained in step 2.</li>
                    <li>Finally obtain \(d\) by modus ponens using the context formula \(b \lor c\) and the formula
                        obtained in step 3.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>Supposing we have either a car or a bus at our disposal and that both car and bus will keep us dry, we
                concluded that we would stay dry. The context is important. We can't prove that we stay dry just because
                we wish so.</p>
            <p>So far, we used concrete formulas in our proofs. Now let's take a formula \((p \lor q) \land r\). We
                would like to prove that it is equivalent to \(r \land (p \lor q))\). What we can do is that we can
                check whether \(s \land r\) is equivalent to \(r \land s\) and treat the variable \(s\) simply as a
                resulting truth value of the subformula \(p \lor q\). If someone gave is the formula \(s \land r\), we
                wouldn't know if the rewrite was made. This way, we blur the line between concrete formulas and
                schemata. Let's see an example.</p>
            <div class="theorem">\(\{\mathfrak{a} \land \mathfrak{b}\} \vdash \mathfrak{b} \land \mathfrak{a}\).</div>

                </ol>
                <p>We learned something about the conjugation symbol. It does not matter if we swap the position of
                    formulas \(\mathfrak{a}\) and \(\mathfrak{b}\). We say that the conjunction is commutative. Let's
                    prove something seemingly trivial.</p>

                </div>
                <p>First thing you should note is that the context is empty. This means that the formula is true without
                    any supplemental assumtions, which makes such a formula a tautology. You might ask why isn't this
                    formula an axiom. It seems useful to know it from the start. We could add \(\mathfrak{f} \to
                    \mathfrak{f}\) to the set of axiom schemata and nothing would break. But we strive to have a set of
                    axioms which is in some sense minimal. This means that no axiom in the set is provable using the
                    other axioms.</p>
                <p>The following theorem summarizes some important properties of the proof system. Proofs of these
                    statements follow easily from the definition of a proof and the assumption that the rules of the
                    axiomatic system contain modus ponens.</p>
                <div class="theorem"><span class="proof-word">The set of consequences</span>
                    <p>Suppose \(\Gamma\) is a set of formulas. The set of consequences is the set of formulas provable
                        from \(\Gamma\) and it is inductively generated by these rules</p>

                </div>
                <p>One of the important property of this proof system is the so-called deduction theorem. It enables us
                    to move formulas from the context into the conclusion and shows a connection between context and

                <h3>Theories</h3>
                <p>When someone speaks about a theory of groups, or theory of lattices, they automatically assume one
                    works with first order logic. Apart from using logical connectives, this logic has two quantifiers,
                    the so-called existential \((\, \exists\,\)\) and universal \((\,\forall\,\)\) quantifier. We
                    already know that including logical symbols in language is probably a good idea. Their universal
                    interpretation enables us to write tautologies even though there might not be any tautologies in the
                    set of atomic formulas. Why do we need quantifiers? A formula can be satisfiable, true or tautology.
                    We know that tautology does not depend on the given model. But what happens when we fix a model? Now
                    the formula might be satisfiable or true.</p>
                <p>For a single variable in a formula the quantifiers are in correspondence with satisfiability and
                    truth. Fix a language with no functions and only one relation \(r\) and interpret this language in
                    the model with a universe of integers and less than relation. The formula \(\exists x,\: x &lt; 5\)
                    is satisfiable because of number 3, but not true because of number 6. The numbers are the
                    assignments themselves. Explicitly we have assignment functions \(v_1(x) = 3\) and \(v_2(x) = 6\).
                    The situation becomes complicated for more than one variable. What about the atomic formula \(x &lt;
                    y\)? It is not true, but it is satisfiable. This is fine, but rather coarse distinction. For
                    integers we know that for a given number we can always pick a smaller number. Let's look at the
                    formula \(\forall y,\exists x,\: x &lt; y\) and think about the assignment function \(v(x,y)\) for a
                    bit. The function \(v\) assigns integers to the variables \(x\) and \(y\). Let's pretend we can
                    split the assignment function \(v\) into two functions, \(v_x\) and \(v_y\). The function \(v_2\)
                    can assign any number to \(y\), which we model by the universal assignment. The function \(v_1\)
                    then must assign number smaller than \(v_2(y)\). By defining such assignments, we make the formula
                    true.</p>
                <p> The use of quantitiers is essential in mathematics. For example if we switch the quantifiers in the
                    last formula as \(\exists y, \forall x,\: x &lt; y\), the formula is no longer true. Without
                    quantifiers, we could only discern whether the formula is true or satisfiable. With quantifiers, we
                    can see how much it is satisfiable. The formula \(\exists y, \exists x,\: x &lt; y\) being true
                    means that we can find two numbers satisfying the inequality. On the other hand \(\forall y, \exists
                    x,\: x &lt; y\) means we can allways find a smaller number \(x\) for any given number \(y\).</p>
