        <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                The following pages are about mathematical logic. During my engineering studies, I did not care about logic at all. After finishing mechanical engineering I continued studying and chose pure mathematics. For my bachelor thesis I chose to prove a theorem from algebra in a theorem prover. Theorem provers are programs for proving mathematical statements and they realy heavily on logic. I was forced to get aquainted with some not so known types of logic systems and how are used in theorem proving. I soon discovered that I had not understood mathematical logic at all. I don't think it got much better since then. Nevertheless I wanted to put down my thoughs on logic here hoping that writing about it would make at least some ideas clear.

                What is logic? What does it mean when someone says he or she is a logical person? If you ask people what constitutes a logical person, you get various answers. You might hear that such a person is attentive, communicates effectively, and avoids using vague or ambiguous language. It often means that the person tries to ensure that his or her ideas are clear and supported by facts. Words are properly matched to ideas and ideas are properly matched to facts.

                Logic can be described as a study of correct reasoning, and it is a cornerstone of philosophy and also mathematics. It might come as a surprise that mathematicians do not know about logic as much as you would think. They need to know how to reason correctly, but very few mathematicians study logic directly. Those who do are interested in so-called mathematical logic. This branch of mathematics can be roughly divided into the study of sets, the study of the proof structures, and the study of the relationship between formal theories. During my undergraduate studies, I had two courses on logic. One was an introductory course, and the other one was on the computational aspects of logic, or in other words, how can we leverage logic to solve concrete problems. Apart from that, we were taught how to deal with quantifiers, how to structure a proof by contradiction, and a few other tools applicable in mathematics.
