        <h1>Other systems of logic</h1>
        <h2>Natural deduction</h2>

            <p>
                The Hilbert style is not the only way to set up a logic system. The axiomatic systems have mainly axioms and only one rule. What if we had only one axiom and many rules? It turns out that such a system exists. The idea is to reason about the alphabet and not about whole propositions. Let's look at the conjunction. The Hilbert system had an axiom which <i>introduces</i> the proposition involving conjunction, namely the third axiom \(A \to (B \to (A \land B))\). If, for some context \(\Gamma\), we know that \(\Gamma \vdash A\) and \(\Gamma \vdash B\), we can use modus ponens two times to obtain \(\Gamma \vdash A \land B\). It would be nice to have some kind of rule which would build the conjunction out of its parts, something like
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash A \qquad \Gamma \vdash B}{\Gamma \vdash A \land B}$$

            <p>
                The part above the line describes what we assume and the lower part describes what we can build out of the assumptions. This is in agreement with the axiom schema where the modus ponens is build into the introduction rule itself. We can also break apart the conjuction. This is what the fourth and fifth axiom schemas tell us. In order to completely describe the behaviour of conjunction, we need one introduction rule and two elimination rules.
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \qquad \Gamma \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P \land Q} \land_I \qquad \dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \land Q}{\Gamma \vdash P} \land_E \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash P \land Q}{\Gamma \vdash Q} \land_E$$

            <p>
                The implication has one introductory rule and one elimination rule. The elimination rule is exactly modus ponens. If you had not seen the Deduction theorem, the introduction rule might seem suprising. But when you think about the Deduction theorem, it really <i>is</i> a way to introduce implication. Note how the context is changed from \(\Gamma,P\) to \(\Gamma\).
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P \to Q} \to_I \qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash P \to Q \qquad \Gamma \vdash P}{\Gamma \vdash Q} \to_E$$

            <p>
                Next logical connective is the disjunction. The two introduction rules are modelled according to the sixth and seventh axiom. The elimination rule mirrors the eight axiom and is also a context-changing rule.
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P}{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q} \lor_I \qquad \dfrac{\Gamma \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q} \lor_I \qquad \dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q \qquad \Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash R \qquad \Gamma \cup\{Q\} \vdash R}{\Gamma \vdash R} \lor_E$$

            <p>
                The next rule mirrors the ninth axiom schema and is called reductio ad absurdum. after introducing all rules for natural deduction, we will say something more about this rule.
            </p>

            $$\frac{\Gamma \cup\{\lnot P\} \vdash \bot}{\Gamma \vdash P} \bot_E$$

            <p>
                The last rule is called the assumption rule. Remember that we proved \(P \to P\) from the first two axiom schemas. There is nothing above the line which means we do no thave to assume anything to use this rule, <i>this</i> is the rule for introducing assumptions.
            </p>

            $$\frac{}{\Gamma,P \vdash P}$$

            <p>
                It seems that we encoded all the axiom schemas into introduction or elimination rules but the first two. Our first task will be to construct a proof of the first axiom in the style of natural deduction. First we use the assumption rule with context \(\Gamma \cup\{B\}\) and proposition \(A\).
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{}{\Gamma \cup\{A,B\} \vdash A}$$

            <p>
                Using the introduction rule for implication twice, we recover the first axiom schema!
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\dfrac{\dfrac{}{\Gamma \cup\{A,B\} \vdash A}}{\Gamma \cup\{A\} \vdash B \to A} \to_I}{\Gamma \vdash A \to (B \to A)} \to_I$$

            <p>
                We just wrote our first proof using in the natural deduction system. We could also recover the second rule. We already know what is meant by a proof in axiomatic system. The notion of proof in natural deduction is not much different. The pair \((\Gamma,A)\) is called a <i>sequent</i> where \(\Gamma\) is a finite set of propositions and we write \(\Gamma \vdash A\). A proof is then a sequence of sequents in which every sequent is obtain from the previous using elimination or introduction rule, apart from the assumption rule.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the axiomatic system we had a theorem about the nature of provable proposition from the context \(\Gamma\). The next definition describes a similar thing for natural deduction. Thanks to this definition we again obtain the power of induction.
            </p>
            
            <div class="definition">
                The set of sequents provable in natural deduction is defined as a smallest set of sequents closed under the natural deduction rules.
            </div>

            <p>
                One such use of induction in natural deduction system is the following lemma called <b>Weakening</b>. It expresses that the natural deduction is a monotonne system. In other words, adding a hypothesis does not destroy proposition which were earlier provable.
            </p>

            <div class="theorem">
                If \(\Gamma \vdash A\) is provable in natural deduction and \(\Gamma \subset \Delta\), then \(\Delta \vdash A\) is provable in natural deduction.
            </div>

            <div class="proof">
                We will use induction on the set of provable sequents. But what does that mean? First we deal with the assumption rule. Suppose we know that \(\Gamma \cup\{A\} \vdash A\) is provable and want to prove \(\Delta \cup\{A\} \vdash A\). But we know that \(\Delta \cup\{A\} \vdash A\) holds from the assumption rule alone. What about the other rules? Let's take for example the introduction rule for conjunction.

                $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \qquad \Gamma \vdash Q}{\Gamma \vdash P \land Q} \land_I$$

            <p>
            Let's say that \(\Gamma \vdash A \land B\) is provable. This requires that \(\Gamma \vdash A\) and \(\Gamma \vdash B\) are provable too. The induction principle tells us that we can use the theorem statement for the upper part of the introduciton or elimination rule. For the case of introduction rule for conjunction, this means we assume that \(\Delta \vdash A\) and \(\Delta \vdash B\) are provable. using the introduction rule we conclude that also \(\Delta \vdash A \land B\) is provable. Other rules would be checked in the same manner and we would find that all of them respect the provability relation. This means we proved the theorem.
            if \(\Gamma \vdash A\), then \(\Delta \vdash A\).
            </p>
        
            \(\blacksquare\)
            </div>

            <p>
                This is not a rule as the introduction or elimination rules we have seen so far. We cannot derive this rule using other rules. It is called admissible rule which means it does not change the set of provable sequents. We could work without it, but is pleasant to use. For example we can have a more general form of rules we introduced so far
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash A \qquad \Delta \vdash B}{\Gamma \cup \Delta \vdash A \land B}$$

            <p>
                You might have been bothered by the form of the elimination rule for disjunction. The axiom schema has the form of explicit implications, \( (A \to C) \to (B \to C) \to (A \lor B \to C) \), but rule is written without implications. The question is, are these two rules equivalent?
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q \qquad \Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash R \qquad \Gamma \cup\{Q\} \vdash R}{\Gamma \vdash R} \lor_E$$

            $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q \qquad \color{red}{\Gamma \vdash P \to R \qquad \Gamma \vdash Q \to R}}{\Gamma \vdash R} \lor_E$$


            <p>
                Let's say we know, that \(\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q\) and \(\Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash R\) and \(\Gamma \cup\{Q\} \vdash R\) are provable. Using introduction rule for implication we obtain \(\Gamma \vdash P \to R\) and \(\Gamma \vdash Q \to R\). We can use the second form to conclude that \(\Gamma \vdash R\). What about the other way? Assume we know that \(\Gamma \vdash P \lor Q\) and \(\Gamma \vdash P \to R\) and \(\Gamma \vdash Q \to R\) are provable. How can we use the first form of the rule? We use the weakening property to obtain \(\Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash P \to R\) and \(\Gamma \cup\{Q\} \vdash Q \to R\). From the assumption rule we know that \(\Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash P\) and \(\Gamma \cup\{Q\} \vdash Q\). Using introduction rule for implication we finally obtain \(\Gamma \cup\{P\} \vdash R\) and \(\Gamma \cup\{Q\} \vdash R\) and we can use the first form of the rule to conclude that \(\Gamma \vdash R\). This means that the weakening theorem tells us these rules are equivalent! One last remark. We could write the weakening as a rule <i>operating on context</i>
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash P}{\Gamma \cup\{A\} \vdash P} w_I$$

            <h2>Proof by contradiction</h2>

            <p>
                It might come as a surprise that <i>propositional logic</i> has few subtypes. The most known is the classical propositional logic. Such logic is described by the nine axiom schemas we saw earlier, or the corresponding natural deduction rules. Taking only the first eight axiom schemas would mean we work in <i>minimal propositional logic</i> and replacing the last axiom schema with \(\bot \to A\) would mean we work in <i>intuitionistic propositional logic</i>. The axiom schema \(\lnot \lnot A \to A\) is called the double negation elimination. First task is to recover the double negation elimination axiom from the elimination rule for \(\bot\). We can happily prove falsity using implication elimination rule from two simple assumptions.
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\dfrac{}{\{\lnot A\} \vdash \lnot A} \qquad \dfrac{}{\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash \lnot \lnot A}}{\{\lnot A, \lnot \lnot A\} \vdash \bot} \to_I$$

            <p>
                Note the lines above the assumptions. This means we needed to use the assumption rule. The second step is to use the elimination rule for \(\bot\) called reduction ad absurdum. After that we use the introduciton rule for implication and we are done.
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\dfrac{}{\{\lnot A\} \vdash \lnot A} \qquad \dfrac{}{\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash \lnot \lnot A}}{\dfrac{\{\lnot A, \lnot \lnot A\} \vdash \bot}{\dfrac{\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A}{\varnothing \vdash \lnot \lnot A \to A} \to_I} \bot_E} \to_E$$

            <p>
                The reverse implication is similar, but we do not have to use the elimination rule for \(\bot\). This has the consuquence that the reverse implication is provable in minimal propositional logic. We again start with proving falsity.
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\dfrac{}{\{A\} \vdash A} \qquad \dfrac{}{\{\lnot A\} \vdash \lnot A}}{\{A, \lnot A\} \vdash \bot} \to_E$$

            <p>
                Two introduction rules for implications are enough to conclude the desired proposition. In classical logic we therefore have the equivalence \(A \leftrightarrow \lnot \lnot A\).
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\dfrac{}{\{A\} \vdash A} \qquad \dfrac{}{\{\lnot A\} \vdash \lnot A}}{\dfrac{\{A, \lnot A\} \vdash \bot}{\dfrac{\{A\} \vdash \lnot A \to \bot}{\varnothing \vdash A \to \lnot \lnot A} \to_I} \to_I} \to_E$$


            <h2>The law of excluded middle</h2>

            <p>
                Another famous thing in logic is the law of excluded middle. It says that the proposition \(P \lor \lnot P\) is true without any further assumptions. The proof is tricky and not intuitive at all. Let's start at the end. In order to prove \(P \lor \lnot P\) we use reductio ad absurdum.
            </p>

            $$\frac{\varnothing\vdash \lnot (A \lor \lnot A) \vdash \bot}{\varnothing \vdash A \lor \lnot A} \bot_E$$

            <p>
                After that we use modus ponens (elimination rule for implication). The right side can be proved by the assumption rule immediately. The problem is with the left side colored in red.
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\dfrac{\vdots}{\textcolor{red}{\{\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)\} \vdash A \lor \lnot A}} \qquad \dfrac{}{\{\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)\} \vdash\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)}}{\dfrac{\varnothing \vdash \lnot (A \lor \lnot A) \vdash \bot}{\varnothing \vdash A \lor \lnot A} \bot_E} \to_E$$

            <p>
                We only need to prove one part of the disjunction thanks to the introduction rule for disjunction. If you try to come up with the proof, you would have to try which part is provable. I will reveal that choosing to prove \(\lnot A\) is the right way. The next step is to use reductio ad absurdum again and modus ponens. The left part follows from the assumption rule.
            </p>

            $$\dfrac{\dfrac{}{\{\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)\} \vdash \lnot(A \lor \lnot A)} \qquad \dfrac{\vdots}{\color{red}{\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A \lor \lnot A}}}{\dfrac{\{\lnot \lnot A,\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)\} \vdash \bot}{\dfrac{\{\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)\} \vdash \lnot A}{\color{red}{\{\lnot(A \lor \lnot A)\} \vdash A \lor \lnot A}} \lor_I} \bot_E} \to_E$$

            <p>
                The right part seems even worse than what we have to prove but don't worry. Knowing \(\lnot \lnot A \vdash A\) we can use introduction rule for disjunction to quickly finish the proof.
            </p>
            
            $$\dfrac{\dfrac{}{\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A} \vdash}{\color{red}{\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A \lor \lnot A}} \lor_I$$

            <p>
                The provability of \(\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A\) does not follow from the assumption rule but had to be proved. That is why I added the symbol \(\vdash\) next to the line. It is not an offical rule but it is quite reasonable to write it this way. Remember that the symbol \(\vdash\) stands for provability. It makes sense to have a kind of introduction rule for statements <i>we have already proved</i>. We do this in mathematics all the time. We start by proving small lemmas and then use them to make bigger ones until we end up with rather complex theorems. It resembles the <i>structural rule</i> for weakening as we act on the structure of the proof. Of course we could simply copy the whole proof of \(\{\lnot \lnot A\} \vdash A\) here.
