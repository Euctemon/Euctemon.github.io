    <h1>Why</h1>
    <p>
        The point of these websites is to have a little place on the internet where I can share the things I am interested in. I enjoy clear and beautifully presented explanations and I try to push myself to do the same when writing about a topic I like.
    </p>

    <h1>Education</h1>
    <h2>High school</h2>
    <p>
        In high school I was particulary interested in mathematics and partly in physics and chemistry. I don't primarily like overly abstract things and kind of gravitated toward experiments. For example I remember making a model of fructose in our chemistry class from the molecular model set. I even have one at home and play with it from time to time. Unfortunaly the physics labs and lectures were not good. When deciding for which university I should apply, I knew I wouldn't be able to take on physics at the university level. I did not want to pursue pure mathematics because I had no idea how could I use that in real life. I thus ended up studying engineering.
    </p>

    <h2>CTU</h2>
    <p>
        I chose the Czech technical university in Prague and more specifically the faculty of mechanical engineering. Apart from Lagrangian mechanics I found the undergraduate studies boring. I had no intention to design engines or drilling machines. For the graduate programme I chose biomechanics which was a specialization offered by the department of mechanics. It featured the most interesting topics in mechanics such as hyperelasticity. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We all had to pass the c language course in undergraduate. For those who chose a programme under the department of mechanics, it was mandatory to pass another course on programming. This time it was focused on parallel programming in c++. Let's just say nobody was sufficiently prepared for a course like that but all miraculously passed it. Weirdly enough I started playing with Haskell which is a functional language in contract to c which is procedural one. I had to pick up the basics by myself because it was not taught at the university. I like this style of programming and stuck with Haskell for a while. In the last semester i was thinking whether I should apply for a doctorate position at CTU or do something else. Well, I ended up doing something else.

    <h2>Charles university</h2>

    <p>
        Woohoo.
