    <h1>High school</h1>
    <p>
        In high school I was particularly interested in mathematics and partly in physics and chemistry. I don't like overly abstract things and naturally gravitate toward experiments. For example, I remember making a model of fructose in our chemistry class from the molecular model set. I even have one at home and play with it from time to time. Unfortunately, the physics labs and lectures were quite bad. When I pondered which university I should apply to, I knew I wouldn't be able to take on physics at the university level. I also didn't want to pursue pure mathematics because I had no idea how I could use that in real life. I thus decided to study engineering.

    <h1>CTU</h1>
    <p>
        I chose the Czech Technical University in Prague and, more specifically, the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. I loved Lagrangian mechanics, but that was it. Surprisingly, I wasn't happy with mathematics there. It was all about learning a specific procedure and then solving a lot of boring problems without a deep understanding. I also quickly learned that I did not like to design things. I wasn't happy with the idea of learning the parts of an engine and then trying to design a better one. I wanted to explore something new and not just apply what I learned. This mindset reflected the choice of a topic for the bachelor's thesis. I investigated the nonstationary behavior of a Segner wheel. In less fancy words, I played with a rotary sprinkler. I did not care how to use it for irrigation purposes. I just really wanted to understand how sprinklers work.

        For a graduate program, I chose biomechanics. It was a specialisation offered by the department of mechanics and featured interesting topics in advanced mechanics, such as hyperelasticity. But there were two problems. First, we had poor programming courses. After one introductory course on the C language, we had to take a course on parallel computing in C++. We had no idea what was happening the whole semester, and the credits were for solving a programming assignment at home. Moreover, I discovered Haskell, which is a functional programming language, and I liked it more than procedural languages like C or C++. Another problem was that we did not know enough rigorous math to tackle the harder problems of advanced mechanics. My master's thesis was again quite experimental. I was trying to measure the swelling of an axon during the neural impulse. The results were inconclusive, but it was a lot of fun. During the last semester I had to think about whether I wanted to apply for a doctorate position at CTU or do something else. I ended up doing something else.

    <h1>Charles university</h1>
    <p>
        I decided that I will study pure mathematics and chose a program called Mathematics for Informational Technology. It's almost the same as the pure mathematics program but with more emphasis on algebra and its use in cryptography, computer algebra, and geometry, rather than analysis. My plan was to learn mathematics I haven't yet encountered, not just learn analysis better. I also continued to play with Haskell. I never learnt Haskell enough to call myself a programmer, but I used it quite often when learning algebra. It was more comfortable to write a program for finding a solution to the Pell equation in Haskell than C. Curiosity provoked me to find out whether there are similar languages to Haskell. I found out about Agda and Idris. These are languages that permit a bit of theorem proving. This means you can write mathematical proofs using these languages. Soon after discovering that such languages exist, I found out about the Lean language. Lean is a full-fledged theorem-proving and functional language. I started to learn how to write proofs in Lean and fell in love with theorem proving.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was so caught up in the idea of writing proofs as programs that I chose theorem proving as a topic of my bachelor thesis at Charles University. My task was to formalise a statement from commutative algebra in Isabelle, which is yet another theorem prover. I soon found out that theorem proving is tightly coupled with logic. I had a mandatory introductory course on mathematical logic in the second year. I remember doing the bare minimum for that course. I started taking logic more seriously after choosing the topic of the bachelor thesis. In the final semester I took a course on computational logic. That course helped me to understand some aspects of how theorem provers work and how logic can be beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>
        The whole time I wondered whether choosing algebra over analysis was the right choice. You need a lot of real, functional, and numerical analysis to be proficient at the mathematical side of advanced mechanics. It would then be reasonable to study analysis. Choosing algebra compelled me to learn its various branches, including number theory, discrete mathematics, commutative algebra, logic, and category theory. Was it a good choice? I think it was. I lost the opportunity to learn analysis a little bit better but gained a deep understanding of algebra.
